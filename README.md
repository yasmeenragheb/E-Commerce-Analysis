# E-commerce Logistics Operations Project

This project is based on a case study I completed during a technical assessment as part of a job application process.

## Overview:
This case study simulates real-world e-commerce logistics operations using three interconnected datasets: Orders, Deliveries, and Products. The goal is to analyze the data and uncover insights that can help improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Steps:
### 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation:
  * Create a *Date table* using DAX
  * Deliveries Table :
    * Add a Status Column to classify each order as either "Late" or "On Time" based on the actual delivery date compared to the expected delivery date.


### 2. Data Modeling
*Fact Table*: Orders

*Dimension Tables*: 
Products 
Date 
Deliveries 
### This is how the star schema looks:
