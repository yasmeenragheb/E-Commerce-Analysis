# E-commerce Logistics Operations Project

This project is based on a case study I completed during a technical assessment as part of a job application process.

## Overview:
This case study simulates real-world e-commerce logistics operations using three interconnected datasets: Orders, Deliveries, and Products. The goal is to analyze the data and uncover insights that can help improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.
